# rotten-want-to-see
I love rotten tomatoes but there are no features for sorting my want-to-see list. 
So I built this software to let me see the list sorted by score or running time.

###How can I use this magical wizardry?
1. Have [pandas, bs4, requests, html5lib, re] all installed
2. Install Jupyter Notebook
3. Go to your Rotten Tomatoes WTS list and save the page as an HTML file.
4. Place the HTML file and the notebook in the same folder
5. Run the notebook, and you should be good to go!
